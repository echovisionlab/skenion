# Roadmap

This roadmap orders the first public Skenion repositories by contract risk.
The goal is to stabilize the shared language before building a large Studio UI.

## Current Order

1. `skenion-contracts`
2. `skenion-sdk`
3. `skenion-runtime`
4. `skenion-examples`
5. `skenion-studio`

## 1. Contracts

`skenion-contracts` is the source of truth for graph documents, node definition
manifests, live protocol envelopes, and HTTP surfaces.

Immediate work:

- release the current v0.1 graph and node definition contract
- expose a TypeScript package for schema constants and validation helpers
- keep `schemaVersion: "0.0.0"` graph files as the frozen legacy baseline
- keep v0.1 graph documents as patch wiring documents, not runtime schedules

The TypeScript SDK and Rust runtime should consume this repository rather than
copying schemas.

## 2. SDK

`skenion-sdk` starts before Studio because node authoring and manifest
normalization need to be stable before a visual editor depends on them.

Immediate work:

- provide `defineNode()` for script and plugin node manifests
- provide `t.*` type builders that emit v0.1 `flow + dataKind + constraints`
- validate generated manifests through `@skenion/contracts`
- expose only the v0.1 script lifecycle hooks: `onInit`, `onInput`,
  `onEvent`, and `onDispose`

The SDK must stay UI-framework agnostic.

## 3. Runtime

`skenion-runtime` should load and validate the same node definition manifests
that the SDK emits.

Immediate work:

- load built-in node manifests
- reject unsupported permissions and incompatible graph edges
- compile graph documents into runtime internals without persisting scheduler
  details back into the graph document
- expose MVP control over WebSocket Protobuf envelopes and HTTP diagnostics

## 4. Examples

`skenion-examples` should prove the contract and SDK with small, public,
license-clean projects.

Immediate work:

- minimal value graph
- bang/event trigger graph
- video asset decode and GPU upload graph
- audio analysis signal graph
- script node authoring example

Examples must not depend on unpublished private packages.

## 5. Studio

`skenion-studio` comes after the contract, SDK, and runtime loader have enough
shape to avoid baking temporary model assumptions into the editor.

Initial Studio direction:

- React + TypeScript + Mantine
- `@xyflow/react` for the canvas interaction layer
- Skenion Graph v0.1 as the saved project format
- React Flow state as a derived view model only
- edge validation delegated to the Skenion compatibility validator

Auto-layout can add ELK.js later when the graph model and canvas needs are
clearer.
